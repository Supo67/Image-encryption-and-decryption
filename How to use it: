User just need to download the file, and run the image_encryption_decryption.py, on local system.
After running a GUI window appears, where user needs to choose an image file using CHOOSE button on the top right corner.
After selecting the image, two images will appear on screen one on left side, which is original and one on write in which Encrypted Decrypted format will be shown.
Now user can start encryption and decryption using Encrypt and Decrypt button.
After editing user can also save the edited image to any location in local system using SAVE button.
Also there is a RESET button, clicking on which resets the edited image to original format.
Also there is exit button, clicking on which we get a exit dialog box asking the permission to exit.
